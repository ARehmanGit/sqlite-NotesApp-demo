# SQLite Implementation Concept
## Showcasing how to integrate SQLite into a Flutter App
## Performing SQLite Crud Operations

### This demo is only using SetState and basic State Management, The same concept can be implemented using Riverpod 2.0 Notifier which can also enable performing crud functionalities from across the app and provide one extra layer of abstraction which can further help in decoupling Business Logic from Widgets , I have implemented this in my second soon to be released app on Play Store
